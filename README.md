# Log Archive Tool

A simple Bash tool to archive logs into timestamped `.tar.gz` files, prune old logs, and manage archive retention.  
Useful for keeping systems clean while still keeping historical logs.

## Features
- Archives logs older than **N days** into `.tar.gz`
- Skips already-compressed files (`.gz`, `.xz`, `.bz2`, `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tgz`, `.zst`)
- Prevents archiving its own output
- Atomic writes (`.partial` â†’ final `.tar.gz`)
- Deletes old logs (optional)
- Deletes old archives after retention period
- Works in:
  - **Interactive menu mode**
  - **Non-interactive CLI mode** (good for cron/systemd)
